**Detail Workflow For Stock Guru Agent**
- Market Analysis Agent Workflow
  1. Start Node (Workflow Initiation)
    a. This node begins the market analysis workflow.
    b. It collects user input, such as stock ticker symbols, sectors, or financial metrics of interest.
    c. Tagged as Conversational and InvestmentGuardian, indicating it is designed for financial insights.
  2. Prompt (LLM Processing)
    a. A Large Language Model (LLM) processes the userâ€™s request.
    b. It interprets financial terms, refines queries, and generates structured requests for data retrieval.

  3. API Call (Fetch Market Data)
    a. The workflow sends a request to Alpha Vantage (https://www.alphavantage.co/query).
    b. Retrieves real-time stock prices, forex data, cryptocurrency details, and market indicators.
    c. Uses parameters like stock ticker symbols and timeframes based on user input.
  4. JavaScript Processing (Data Handling & Computation)
    a. Executes JavaScript to process the API response.
    b. Extracts relevant data, such as price trends and volume.
    c. Performs additional calculations or formatting for better visualization.
  5. Display Nodes (Presenting Data to the User)
    - Two display nodes show the results:
      a. Main Display: Presents refined financial insights.
      b. Secondary Display: Could show raw API responses or intermediate calculations.
  6. Conditional Paths (Handling Success or Failure)
    a. Success Path: If the API call works, data moves to the JavaScript node for processing.
    b. Failure Path: If the API fails (e.g., invalid stock ticker or API limit exceeded), an error message is displayed.
